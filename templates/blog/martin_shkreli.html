        <p>Martin Shkreli may have been the most hated CEO in America in 2015, but at least he had moderator status on WallStreetBets. Before that fateful year, when he was dragged into the American limelight smirking and giggling for raising the price of Daraprim, an anti-parasitic drug used to treat toxoplasmosis in AIDS patients, from $13.50 a pill to $750 a pill, things had been going pretty well for the Brooklyn-born hedge fund manager. At only 32-years-old, he was worth roughly $70 million, and he was able to buy the sole copy of Wu Tang Clan’s album Once Upon a Time in Shaolin for $2 million at an auction earlier that year. Life was pretty great.</p>
        <p>Martin wasn’t your typical hedge fund manager. The son of immigrants—both of whom worked as janitors in Brooklyn—he once proclaimed that he was “the most successful Albanian to ever walk the face of this earth.” He had dropped out of high school before his senior year but was able to get enough credits for his diploma through a program that earned him an internship at the Wall Street hedge fund Cramer, Berkowitz, & Co. when he was only 17.</p>
        <p>As an intern at the Jim Cramer founded hedge fund, he didn’t want to just blend in. He wanted to be a star. “I don’t even remember him working for me,” Cramer would later tell Vanity Fair’s Bethany McLean. But Shkreli knew what he saw in the mirror, even if nobody else saw it yet. This was the greatest Albanian to ever walk the face of this earth. A big swinging dick. “Who are the 5 greatest rappers of all time?” he would later ask Twitter in a 2015 tweet. His answer a couple minutes later: “Martin, Martin, Martin, Martin, and Martin.”</p>
        <figure>

            <figcaption>Who's that handsome man in the mirror?</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>At only 17-years-old, having been a loyal employee at Cramer, Berkowitz, & Co. for several months, he began clamoring for his employer to begin short-selling Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, a biotech company that was testing a weight-loss drug at the time. Somehow, he got them to listen, and when Regeneron stock tumbled, Cramer’s hedge fund made a tidy profit. That’s right, Martin told that handsome face in the mirror, the greatest Albanian to walk this earth.</p>
        <p>After four years as an associate at Cramer, Berkowitz, & Co., Shkreli felt it was time to move on to greener pastures. He ended up getting a business degree from New York’s Baruch College in 2004, and then worked as a financial analyst at Intrepid Capital Management for a while. But he was tired of just being some financial grunt. He wanted to ball out. So in 2006, he started his own hedge fund and christened it Elea Capital Management. He was about to make bank, bro.</p>
        <p>In 2007, Lehman Brothers sued Elea in New York state court for failing to cover a put option transaction in which Shkreli bet on a broad market decline (did Martin YOLO on 0DTE SPY puts? Perhaps*). Stocks rose though, and Shkreli didn’t have the money to pony up. Lehman ended up winning a $2.3 million judgement against Elea and Shkreli, but Lehman collapsed before it could collect on the ruling. Something about its own bad bets on mortgage-backed securities. Shkreli dabbed in his corner office.</p>
        <p>The fund eventually sizzled into insolvency though, so in September of 2009, Martin started MSMB Capital Management with his childhood friend Marek Biestek. The two began aggressively shorting biotech companies and expounding upon these companies’ flaws in trading chat rooms. Shkreli was still in his 20s and he had made the Forbes 30 Under 30 list.</p>
        <p>In early 2011, MSMB sold short 11 million shares of Orexigen Therapeutics after it had already fallen off a cliff, from $9.90 to $2.50 a share. In the ensuing days and weeks, Orexigen rebounded, and suddenly MSMB could not cover their position. MSMB had effectively imploded. Martin sat slumped in his chair, his hoodie drawn up, staring at his screen. Caroline Stewart, who worked for the firm at the time, said that after the failed trade “everything went quiet” in the firm. “The lights were not turned on. People stopped coming into work.” Shkreli informed her that he owed Merrill Lynch—the broker he used in his naked short sale—$10 million. He didn’t tell his investors though that their money had gone up in flames.</p>
        <p>In his dark moments, Shkreli found a way out though: he’d just start another hedge fund, this one called MSMB Healthcare. He was able to convince investors to back him again, and MSMB Healthcare would become a lifeline for the original MSMB fund. With one fund bailing the other out, Shrkeli would rise from the ashes like an autistic phoenix. He was no quitter. He was the greatest Albanian to walk this earth.</p>
        <p>Why stop at a new hedge fund though? Martin understood pharmaceuticals—he used his spare time to create educational chemistry videos which he uploaded to YouTube—so why couldn’t he run his own pharma company? So, at about the same time that the OG MSMB blew up in spectacular fashion, he founded Retrophin. The company would have an emphasis on biotechnology that could be used to create treatments for rare diseases.</p>
        <p>As CEO, Shkreli and his employees created alias Twitter accounts to make gangster rap jokes and encourage the short selling of other biotech stocks. In 2014, he upped the price of a drug called Thiola, which was used to treat the rare disease cystinuria, from $1.50 to $30 a pill (patients had to take 10-15 pills a day).</p>
        <p>For some reason, Retrophin’s board decided in 2014 that Shkreli, while intelligent, was too immature to be CEO of the company he founded. He was ousted as CEO, and a month later he left the fourth firm he founded. What was next? Why, found another pharmaceutical company, of course.</p>
        <p>In February of 2015, he founded Turing Pharmaceuticals which acquired three major drugs from Retrophin: an intranasal version of ketamine used to treat depression, an intranasal version of oxytocin—the hormone and neurotransmitter commonly known as the “love drug” that is involved in childbirth and breast-feeding—and a drug called Vecamyl, which was used to treat hypertension. The business strategy for Turing was simple: obtain licenses on out-of-patent drugs and raise prices as time passed. The markets for out-of-patent drugs are often small, and the pathway to obtaining regulatory approval to manufacture a generic version of a drug is expensive, so Shkreli saw that with closed distribution and essentially no competition, the sky was the limit in terms of pricing.</p>
        <p>Only a couple months after Turing’s inception, they acquired Daraprim, a drug approved by the FDA in 1953, for $55 million. In line with their business strategy, Daraprim’s patent had expired, and no generic version was yet available. So Turing increased the price of Daraprim overnight by a factor of 56, and the world took notice. Or, put bluntly, an angry American mob formed.</p>

        </figure>
        <p>In September of that year, Shkreli still was willing to explain himself. He told Bloomberg Markets that despite the huge increase in price, patient co-pays would actually be lower (insurance companies, for the most part, would be footing the bill, not average Americans), and many patients would get the drug for free thanks to Turing’s expanded drug program. Under the program, half of its drugs sold for one dollar. “If there was a company that was selling an Aston Martin at the price of bicycle,” he told Bloomberg, “and we buy that company and ask to charge Toyota prices, I don’t think that should be a crime.”</p>
        <p>But America was frothing at the mouth. In 2015, with a presidential election looming, candidates Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, and Donald Trump all condemned Shkreli and his actions. The optics of the price hike were certainly not good. A few days after his interview with Bloomberg, Shkreli announced that he planned to lower the price of Daraprim by an unspecified amount, but a couple months later, Turing apparently changed its mind and decided there would be no price cut.</p>
        <p>During all this turbulence, it was revealed that Shkreli had purchased Once Upon a Time in Shaolin for $2 million at an auction that was held months before the price hike of Daraprim. The public was not pleased. In an interview in 2019 with Joe Rogan, RZA revealed he had tried to advise Shkreli to “take this chance to do some philanthropy” and give the album away to the public. But Shkreli refused. “He didn’t mind being a supervillain,” RZA said. After meeting with him, RZA didn’t seem to have the hate in his heart for Shkreli that the rest of the public did. “He was a very smart dude.”</p>
        <p>In December of 2015, Shkreli was arrested by the FBI after a federal indictment was filed for securities fraud unrelated to Daraprim’s price. His charges were related to his time as the Chief Investment Officer of MSMB Capital Management and CEO of Retrophin. At a news conference, U.S. Attorney Robert Capers told reporters that Shkreli used his companies as “a personal piggy bank” and that essentially, he was running a Ponzi scheme. The New York FBI Twitter page made an announcement: “#Breaking no seizure warrant at the arrest of Martin Shkreli today, which means we didn’t seize the Wu-Tang Clan album.” Shkreli told The Wall Street Journal that he had been targeted for his price hike of Daraprim and his flamboyant personality.</p>

        <p>Because of his notoriety, it became clear that it would be difficult to find an unbiased jury. In a transcript released by Harper’s Magazine, the following excerpts shed insight into what the public thought of the 32-year-old former hedge fund manager (Benjamin Brafman was the lawyer representing Shkreli, “The Court” being Judge Kiyo Matsumoto):</p>
        <p>The Court: The purpose of jury selection is to ensure fairness and impartiality in this case. If you think that you could not be fair and impartial, it is your duty to tell me. All right. Juror Number 1.</p>
        <p>Juror No. 1: I’m aware of the defendant and I hate him.</p>
        <p>Benjamin Brafman: I’m sorry.</p>
        <p>The Court: Jurors are obligated to decide the case based only on the evidence. Do you agree?</p>
        <p>Juror No. 1: I don’t know if I could. I wouldn’t want me on this jury.</p>
        <p>The Court: Juror Number 1 is excused.</p>
        <p class="blog-section">***</p>
        <p>The Court: Juror Number 52, how are you?</p>
        <p>Juror No. 52: When I walked in here today, I looked at him, and in my head, that’s a snake — not knowing who he was. I just walked in and looked right at him and that’s a snake.</p>
        <p>Brafman: So much for the presumption of innocence.</p>
        <p>The Court: We will excuse Juror Number 52.</p>
        <p class="blog-section">***</p>
        <p>The Court: Juror Number 77.</p>
        <p>Juror No. 77: From everything I’ve seen on the news, everything I’ve read, I believe the defendant is the face of corporate greed in America.</p>
        <p>Brafman: We would object.</p>
        <p>Juror No. 77: You’d have to convince me he was innocent rather than guilty.</p>
        <p>The Court: I will excuse this juror.</p>
        <p class="blog-section">***</p>
        <p>The Court: Juror Number 144, tell us what you have heard.</p>
        <p>Juror No. 144: I heard through the news of how the defendant changed the price of a pill by up-selling it. I heard he bought an album from the Wu-Tang Clan for a million dollars.</p>
        <p>The Court: The question is, have you heard anything that would affect your ability to decide this case with an open mind. Can you do that?</p>
        <p>Juror No. 144: I don’t think I can because he kind of looks like a dick.</p>
        <p>The Court: You are Juror Number 144 and we will excuse you. Come forward, Juror Number 155.</p>
        <p>Juror No. 155: I have read a lot of articles about the case. I think he is as guilty as they come.</p>
        <p>The Court: Then I will excuse you from this case. Juror Number 10, please come forward.</p>
        <p>Juror No. 10: The only thing I’d be impartial about is what prison this guy goes to.</p>
        <p>The Court: Okay. We will excuse you. Juror 28, do you need to be heard?</p>
        <p>Juror No. 28: I don’t like this person at all. I just can’t understand why he would be so stupid as to take an antibiotic which H.I.V. people need and jack it up five thousand percent. I would honestly, like, seriously like to go over there —</p>
        <p>The Court: Sir, thank you.</p>
        <p>Juror No. 28: Is he stupid or greedy? I can’t understand.</p>
        <p>The Court: We will excuse you.</p>
        <p class="blog-section">***</p>
        <p>The Court: Juror Number 59, come on up.</p>
        <p>Juror No. 59: Your Honor, totally he is guilty and in no way can I let him slide out of anything because —</p>
        <p>The Court: Okay. Is that your attitude toward anyone charged with a crime who has not been proven guilty?</p>
        <p>Juror No. 59: It’s my attitude toward his entire demeanor, what he has done to people.</p>
        <p>The Court: All right. We are going to excuse you, sir.</p>
        <p>Juror No. 59: And he disrespected the Wu-Tang Clan.</p>
        <p class="blog-section">***</p>
        <p>The case would get dragged out for over a year, but on August 4, 2017, the trial jury that The Court was finally able to assemble had found Shkreli guilty on two counts of security fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud. He was found not guilty of five other counts. It’s worth noting that he was never found guilty of the charges the public deemed him most guilty of—jacking up the price of Daraprim.</p>
        <p>Shkreli informed the media that he was “delighted” with the outcome and said that his prosecution was a “witch hunt of epic proportions.” A month after the ruling, his bail was revoked after he posted on Facebook offering $5,000 for a strand of Hillary Clinton’s hair. Preceding posts unveiled devious plans to clone Hillary Clinton. The judge didn’t think this was funny though, and he was sent to the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn to await sentencing.</p>
        <p>He would appeal the conviction, but in 2019 the appeals court unanimously upheld the jury verdict. Shkreli would continue to serve his 7-year sentence and forfeit more than $7.3 million in assets. Judge Kiyo Matsumoto said Shkreli did appear to be “genuinely remorseful”, but that he had “repeatedly minimized” his conduct. In his statement to The Court, Shkreli apparently became misty-eyed as he told The Court that he was “never motivated by money."</p>

        </figure>
        <p>What did WallStreetBets think of Shkreli and his rise and fall? It’s complicated. While some saw him as a villain, many believed he was misunderstood. While he did raise the price of Daraprim, insurance companies would be picking up most of the tab. Martin did give the drug away for free to those who didn’t have insurance. But it also seemed as though Martin was willing to play the role of the heel. While he at first tried to explain to the public why he didn’t see the price hike as such an egregious act, and then offered to lower the price, he ultimately rescinded his offer and made a joke about his whole trial. Pharmaceutical companies regularly raise the price of drugs, but they often do it slowly over time, in increments that do not raise alarm bells on Main Street. These companies are not much different, they’re just less in-your-face. Raising the drug by over 5,000% overnight was undoubtedly bad optics, but to say it was an attack on the middle-class or those with AIDS seems to be leaving out details of how American healthcare is flawed in myriad ways. Maybe Martin thought he was sticking it to the insurance companies.</p>
        <p>For a time, Martin was a regular poster at WallStreetBets. He popped in somewhat regularly to give his thoughts on pharma stocks and drugs that were in development. When he started serving time in jail—a friend would post on Reddit for him—Martin assured everyone that prison wasn’t “that bad”. It wasn’t like how it was portrayed in TV, he said, but “more of a weird college where no one studies or knows how to read.”</p>
        <p>Occasionally, he would slide into other Reddit subs that weren’t WallStreetBets. During the height of his notoriety and the approaching trial, he asked r/iamverybadass in a post, "U got a problem with me?”</p>
        <p>Many on WallStreetBets appreciated Martin for the countless hours he spent creating educational YouTube videos on chemistry and investing (they’re worth a look). Martin was undeniably intelligent, but he was also a troll. His sense of humor, for the most part, was welcome at WallStreetBets even though much of America didn’t feel the same way. Maybe the media had already decided on a narrative for Martin.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, WallStreetBets couldn’t shelter Martin from the rest of the world. And in February of 2016, he wrote another post titled, “Where did my mod status go?” The body of the post simply read, “Noobs.”</p>
