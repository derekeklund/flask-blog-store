        <p class="fst-italic">This article was originally written in 2020.</p>
        <p>“Never invest in a business you cannot understand.” These sage words have been uttered many times over the years by Warren Buffett and those who value his advice. The Oracle of Omaha has, at the time of this publication, amassed a fortune of over $80 billion by following his own simple advice. So when oil futures went negative in April of 2020 following a 30% drop in global oil demand due to the coronavirus pandemic, WSB collectively decided to sit on their hands and watch.</p>

        <p>Just kidding! That’s what loser boomers did. WSB was full of big swinging dicks who entered trades they didn’t understand, fundamentals and caution be dammed. So when oil futures turned negative in April of 2020 due to a 30% reduction in global demand stemming from the coronavirus pandemic, WSB began frothing at the mouth. There was money to be made… somehow.</p>
        <p>Since there was less demand for oil—nobody was driving cars these days since many were under lockdown or working from home—there was a lot of oil that nobody wanted. The oil had already been slurped up from the Earth’s crust, and it was sitting in barrels waiting to be processed, but there was nowhere to put it. Storage was already just about full, and the people who owned futures contracts for oil were now frantically trying to find buyers to take their oil, sending prices into the negative-double digits.*</p>
        <p>Futures contracts are different than options. While an options contract gives you the option to buy or sell shares at a certain price in the future, a futures contract is an agreement for a commodity to be delivered at a future date. No backsies. If you don’t want hundred or thousands of barrels of oil—or bushels of corn or soybeans or ornamental gourds—you have to fund a buyer for your contract. Otherwise, you’d be sitting there with a whole lot of product, and then it’s on you to find somewhere to store it, someone to sell it to, and there’s just a much bigger process involved that could vacuum up cash.</p>
        <p>When West Texas Intermediate (WTI), the benchmark for US crude oil, saw prices turn negative on Monday, April 20th, this was actually in reference to the futures contracts that had to be delivered in May. These contracts expired on Tuesday the 21st, and traders who held the contracts were not equipped to receive physical deliveries. But nobody wanted those barrels because there was nowhere to store them. Cushing, Oklahoma was where much of the U.S. crude oil was delivered, and since it would be difficult (and costly) to send the oil elsewhere, the price started to nosedive. This situation is what’s called “super contango”. Contango is a scenario where the futures price of a commodity is higher than the spot price; the asset price is expected to rise over time. Super contango usually occurs when storage space becomes scares because there’s too much supply, and the cost to carry, or store the commodity, effectively rises.</p>

        <p>All of this was detailed in a post written by u/lolchitect on April 21st where he detailed how he had bought a few contracts of WTI May 20th futures when it was at -$32 on the 20th. He took profits as the price rose, but he still had one contract as the price rose up to -$4. The single contract had become worth over $26,000, but the liquidity had dried up. No one would buy the contract from him, and it was set to expire on the 21st. Unsympathetic WSBettors congratulated u/lolchitect on the 1000 barrels of oil that were set to be delivered to his front door. While the barrels wouldn’t actually be delivered to his home, he was contractually obligated to pick up the oil, and if he couldn’t take the delivery he’d be sued.</p>
        <p>One person in the thread said they had access to two million barrels worth of storage along the gulf coast and to hit him up if he was desperate in a few days. Another commenter said he had storage in Oklahoma along with the trucks to haul it. “If you end up needing to ‘give the oil away’ we can probably take it.”</p>
        <p>u/Arnolds_Left_Bicep suggested a get-rich quick plan in the comments:</p>
        <p>Step 1: Buy 6,300,000 barrels of oil at -$32 per barrel.</p>
        <p>Step 2: Get credited $201 million.</p>
        <p>Step 3: Register a new company as oil tanker farmer, higher employees and acquire necessary tech/equipment.</p>
        <p>Step 4: Spend $60-70 million to build oil tank farm with 1 million m3 capacity including connected pipeline.</p>
        <p>Step 5: Take delivery of oil.</p>
        <p>Step 6: Wait a few years, sell your oil back at $20+ per barrel once prices rise.</p>
        <p>Step 7: Retire early.</p>
        <p>Boom. Problem solved.</p>
        <p>Luckily for u/lolchitect, some mysterious hero did buy the contract as time was running out—his multimillion oil conglomerate plan could be shelved for the time being. He ended up netting $29,790.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the best and brightest minds of WallStreetBets went to work. Some were considering buying oil now that it was negative, storing the barrels in their home, and waiting for that V-shaped recovery that was due to happen eventually. Others talked about ditching their dream to own a yacht and purchasing a tanker instead.</p>
        <p>A thesis emerged on the sub: if storage space for oil was getting low, rates to store the oil would go up. Who did they believe would benefit? Oil tankers. Euronav (EURN), Scorpio Tankers Inc. (STNG), and DHT Holdings Inc. (DHT) were all likely candidates to benefit from contango.</p>
        <p>But it didn’t play out that way. Despite all three companies seeing strong earnings calls in the ensuing months, the stocks didn’t rip face like everyone had predicted. They actually went down over the coming months. Suddenly Tanker Gang had become bagholders.</p>
        <p>What had happened? There were theories that something sinister was afoot. Some believed market makers were pinning the prices of these tanker companies to specific spots known as the max pain price. This max pain price is the strike price with the most open contracts of puts and calls and would cause the most financial losses for the largest number of option holders. Remember that market makers are often the ones selling the options, and if they could hypothetically keep a price just out of the money for the calls or puts they sold they could save a lot of money. A market maker that had sold calls to WSB could sell shares of the underlying asset to drive prices down (inversely, put writers could buy shares of the underlying to drive prices up). There’s a bit of controversy regarding max pain theory. Some believe a stock’s tendency to move towards the max pain strike price is chance, and others believe this is a clear sign of market manipulation. Institutional players might label the latter group as conspiracy theorists, but it’s not out of the realm of possibility that market makers could do this. But sometimes the market just moves against you. Either way, Tanker Gang wouldn’t be trading in their tankers for yachts anytime soon.</p>
