        <p>Some of the most intelligent traders have poked their heads into WallStreetBets over the years. Doctors, lawyers, engineers, PhD students—they’ve all produced some solid research, both in their fields and outside of them. And while there was a deep respect in the sub for the likes of Michael Burry and Steve Eisman, there was also an appreciation for some of the more basement-dwelling types. The retards, they were called. Every once in a while, a retard would make such a splash in the very warm pool that was WSB and achieve a level of notoriety and fame. A smooth-brained messiah. One such figure went by the name of Analfarmer2.</p>

        </figure>
        <p>Analfarmer2 started out on WSB the way new many members do: as a bright-eyed child, lured into the den that was WSB by the 10,000% RobinHood returns that would make it to the front page of Reddit every couple of months or so. Someone else had done it, so why couldn’t Analfarmer2 also become a 10,000% investor? He also had a phone with RobinHood.</p>
        <p>Like many eager sponges, Analfarmer2 began asking benign questions such as “Got 5k to yolo, any advice on which stock?”, “How am I losing 3 months’ rent in 10 minutes?” and “What happens if I forget to hedge?” After a couple weeks, Analfarmer2 began to ask the bigger questions. Stuff like “How can I stop being so retarded?” and “Should I just delete the RobinHood App?”</p>
        <p>Despite Analfarmer2’s obvious shortcomings, and the fact that he was a college student at UMass Amherst, he was somehow able to amass $114,000 which he dropped on Tesla calls, selling them a week later for a $6,000 gain. When asked how a 19-year-old was able to invest six figures in Tesla, Analfarmer2 replied, “Online biz + margin bb.”</p>
        <p>A little bit later, on July 30th, he dropped $110,000 on Align Technology, an orthodontics company that used 3D digital scanners to produce clear aligners. Again, he bought call, but this time the contracts he purchased only had two days until expiration (an extremely risky bet). Luckily, ALGN announced stock buybacks the next day, which sent the stock and Analfarmer2’s call premiums into the stratosphere. He pocked a $180,000 gain and now was worth over $300,000. A sensible 19-year-old would think, “Hey, I have enough to pay for my college degree, a nice car, and a down payment on a starter home.”</p>
        <p>But Analfarmer2 was not sensible.</p>
        <p>What was Analfarmer2’s next move? Well, he’d been studying the market closely, and he’d noticed something peculiar: the stock market had gone up the day before. And, he figured, what comes up must come down. So, he put $170,000 on SPY puts expiring the next day. As luck would have it, then-President Donald Trump tweeted that night that he’d be announcing tariffs the next day, and the S&P 500 predictably tanked the next morning. Analfarmer2 made another $277,000.</p>

        </figure>
        <p>What was a boy who wasn’t even old enough to buy alcohol to do?</p>
        <p>Why, buy SPY calls of course. The market had gone down the day before, so his research indicated that an upswing was due. He put all of his earnings on SPY calls that would expire the next day (and $2 out of the money, an extremely unlikely bet).</p>
        <p>And he lost.</p>
        <p>Luckily, he was able to sell for a loss and walk away with $200,000. Enough to pay for college and a car. But scared money didn’t make money, so he dove into a couple other trades, his final yolo a $40,000 basket of call options expiring in a week of Canopy Growth which had earnings in a week. Canopy missed earnings, and the stock dropped 6%.</p>
        <p>Analfarmer2 was back to being a broke college kid.</p>
        <p class="blog-section">***</p>
        <p>Some retards are more refined—they make risky trades but with some sprinklings of intelligence. One such WSB degenerate was 1R0NYMAN. He figured out if he bought a bull call spread and a matching bear put spread, with identical strake prices and expiration dates, he could pocket the difference between the two strike prices. This is effectively an arbitrage strategy, which is the purchase and sale of an asset in order to profit from the difference in assets’ price between markets and profiting from the price differences of near identical instruments. Those who set up arbitrage strategies like this benefit from an inefficiency in the market; if markets were perfectly efficient, the prices of the of the two assets would be the same. Usually, the fees to setup a trade like this would outpace the returns, but RobinHood didn’t charge fees.</p>
        <p>All of this might be confusing, even for someone with experience trading options, so here’s an example:</p>
        <hr>
        <p>Papa’s Tendies Emporium (PTE) is trading at $100 a share. To set up a box spread, you’ll buy or sell four legs of options contracts:</p>
        <li>Buy the $99 call for 3.29 (ITM) for $329 debit</li>
        <li>Sell the $103 call for 1.23 (OTM) for $123 credit</li>
        <li>Buy the $103 put for 2.69 (ITM) for $269 debit</li>
        <li>Sell the $99 put for 0.97 (OTM) for $97 credit</li>
        <hr>
        <p>The cost of the box spread (before commissions) would be $329 - $123 + $269 - $97 = $378. The spread between the strike prices is 53 – 49 = 4. Multiply that by 100 (because each options contract gives you the option to buy 100 shares of the underlying stock) and you get $400 for the box spread. So, the trade can produce $22 in profit ($400 - $378), and as long as the commissions are less than $22, the trade remains profitable. And RobinHood had no commissions are negligible. And with RobinHood they were.*</p>
        <p>1R0NYMAN saw this arbitrage opportunity as free money. He chose UVXY, an ETF that measured 1.5 times the daily returns of the S&P VIX short-term futures, and he calculated that the play would make him $38k profit after two years. There appeared to be no risk.</p>
        <p>The trade would have worked if he was dealing with European options, which do not allow you to exercise early. But UVXY options were American, and the options he sold could be exercised at any time. That free money play actually had a hidden max loss of $212,000.</p>
        <p>And low and behold, someone did exercise early and 1R0NYMAN lost $53,000. All from an account that had $5,000 in it.</p>
        <p>Usually there are risk analysts with brokerages who prevent trades like this from happening, but RobinHood didn’t hold enough collateral cash to ensure 1R0NYMAN could pay. It’s not clear whether or not 1R0NYMAN was still on the hook for the –1,060% returns, but RobinHood no longer allows box spreads.</p>
        <p>*RobinHood advertised itself as a brokerage that helped the little guy, but they were able to do commission-free trading from redirecting orders to market makers, a process called Payment for Order Flow (PFOF), which was a practice pioneered by Bernie Madoff, of Ponzi scheme fame.</p>
        <p class="blog-section">***</p>
        <p>The capitalism versus socialism debate is one that’s raged on for centuries now and will continue to rage on long after WSB is inevitably banned and wiped from the internet’s history. A young lad who went by u/ControlTheNarrative threw himself into these sorts of debates when he first joined Reddit. He was the author of such posts as “Capitalists, if you reject workplace democracy, then why do you support national democracy?” and “What about Democracy/Socialism/Distribution in the bedroom?” At one point he asked his fellow Redditors for some good companies “to invest in that don’t have women.”</p>
        <p>So basically, he was your average Reddit troll before he found WSB. And when he did find the sub, he shed all his reservations about capitalism and started using enough leverage in his portfolio that would make a Bear Stearns risk analyst blush. He bought short-dated options right before Microsoft earnings (again, an insanely risky move due to volatility spikes and IV crush) and prompltly lost $30,000. He told WSB that it’d been fun, but that he’d had enough and he’d be leaving the sub.</p>
        <p>But that was a lie. A little bit later, he authored a post in WSB titled “RobinHood is literally giving me free money” where he detailed an apparent loophole in the system involving RobinHood Gold and his margin account. He wrote:</p>
        <p>“With RobinHood Gold, you can use what’s called margin to trade with increased buying power. So I did an instant deposit of 2000 dollars (the minimum required to access Gold Trading), and then I bought 100 shares of AMD for 3,800 or so, with margin. Then I sold an AMD call contract with a 2 dollar strike price to get all my money back (it’s important to find a stock that has call options with such low strike prices like Ford, GE, etc.). Then I use that money to buy TWO hundred shares of AMD because remember, margin doubles my buying power, then I sell 2 call contracts with the same 2 dollar strike price to get all my money back, which is then doubled again thanks to RobinHood’s Margin. I repeat this until I am sufficiently leveraged for my Personal Risk Tolerance. Right now, I am at 25x leverage because I had 2000 dollars in Instant Deposits. I then use my increased buying power to maximize my gains.”</p>
        <p>Steve Eisman, of The Big Short fame, once said that Wall Street “mistook leverage for genius” in the years leading up to the 2008 Financial Crisis. Many on WSB idolized Steve Eisman, played by Steve Carrell in the movie, despite the fact that the investor was currently shorting Tesla at the time. If Wall Street saw themselves as genius for leverage ratios in the single digits, u/ControlTheNarrative was undoubtedly a proud Mensa member. He also was wise to stay within his personal risk tolerance of 25:1 leverage.</p>
        <p>But he really did expose a loophole that RobinHood apparently hadn’t thought about. So how did this happen? The series of events are outlined below:</p>
        <p>After losing his $30,000 on RobinHood, u/ControlTheNarrative asked nicely if he could access margin trading, which RobinHood gladly allowed. In order to have margin, he would simply have to deposit $2,000 to get $2,000 of margin, bringing his total buying power to $4,000. He proceeded to buy 100 shares of AMD, the popular semiconductor manufacturer, with $3,200 of his funds. He immediately sold covered calls at a strike price of $2 to collect $3,288 in premium, bringing his total buying power to $4,088 (remember he still had $800 left over from his initial purchase of 100 AMD shares).</p>
        <p>RobinHood saw that he had over $4,000 in his account and gave him margin again, bringing his total to buying power to $8,176. And naturally, u/ControlTheNarrative bought 200 additional shares of AMD with his artificially inflated margin and immediately sold two more covered calls at the $2 strike, awarding him $6,576 in premium. And thus, the free money machine was created. He completed this loop a couple more times until he had achieved his personal risk tolerance of 25:1 leverage. So with his initial $2,000 investment, he now had over $50,000 in buying power.</p>
        <p>What did he do with all these borrowed funds? He bought $50,000 worth of AAPL puts expiring Friday of that week, at 7% OTM no less. This was one of the most stable, cash-positive companies out there. And he was basically betting on a black swan event for AAPL in the next two days. So basically, unless he was a senator with insider knowledge (see Richard Burr, Kelly Loefler, Nancy Pelosi), this was about as dumb a play out there.</p>
        <p>Apple’s earning report came out, and as expected they crushed earnings, and the puts went to zero.</p>
        <p>For some reason, u/ControlTheNarrative decided to record his reaction when the market opened and he watched his puts lose $50,000. He also decided to post the video to WSB, which immediately laughed at the unnatural guttural noise that escaped the young man’s lips. It sounded something like “Guh."</p>
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NpsOmeFy0Lo" class="blog-center YT" alt="Guh."></iframe>
        <p>And thus, another legend was born.</p>
        <p class="blog-section">***</p>
        <p>Corn Gang. Corn Mob. Children of the Corn. For the rare Redditor who took a couple days away from WallStreetBets in mid-August of 2020 to walk outside or take his girlfriend out in public, he would’ve logged back in to find that WallStreetBets had been transformed into CornHub. All of the talk was suddenly about corn futures and the corn futures ETF that had the apt ticker CORN.</p>
        <p>It all started with a post on August 11th, 2020 when u/iwearagreenbackpack informed the sub of some interesting pieces of information he had dug up. On August 12, at 12PM EST, the CORN yield crop report would be released, and u/iwearagreenbackpack explained how the report would show the corn yield from the previous year would be out of this world. In addition to this, there was a lot of open interest for call options which he believed indicated that the insiders in Big Corn knew something that the average trader did not. Why would there be so many calls purchased if there wasn’t a huge upward movement expected?</p>
        <p>This made a whole lot of sense to WallStreetBets. Everyone piled in, and thus Corn Gang was born. One thread that was posted a bit later detailed the belief that more corn produced = higher prices. No one mentioned that pesky thing about supply and demand. A couple actual farmers popped into the sub to inform everyone buying CORN that they were in fact idiots*, but it was too late. Everyone was instead pointing to how the Mayan Calendar predicted this glorious trade many moons ago; Corn Gang was about to get rich.</p>
        <p>Information during this time was all over the place. Some people reported that a huge storm had ripped through the Midwest, tearing up corn fields and corn silos. 10 million acres of corn fields had been destroyed, semi-trailers had been overturned, and since there was a sudden corn scarcity, CORN prices were set to explode.</p>
        <p>The next day though, the USDA report was ho-hum and there wasn’t much movement. Some people pulled out of their positions as others wondered if this was a deep state ploy by Big Corn to rob everyone blind. It seemed as though WallStreetBets had been whipped up into a frenzy for nothing.</p>
        <p>*The author of this blog may or may not have lost money following Corn Gang’s advice.</p>
        <p class="blog-section">***</p>
        <p>“I am financially ruined,” another post began, posted some four months later by u/TheEmperorOfJenks. “This summer I invested $17,500 (six months of salary and my entire life savings) into ornamental gourd futures, hoping to capitalize on this lucrative emerging industry. After watching a video about Vincent Kosuga and his monopoly on onions*, I decided I'd try to do something similar with another vegetable. I did some research and found out many agricultural forecasters expected this year's gourd yield would be far smaller than the past, due to deteriorating soil conditions in central Mexico and a warmer-than-average spring. At first, demand soared around Halloween and prices skyrocketed, but the gourd bubble burst on November 12th. Unfortunately, COVID-19 caused a massive drop-off in demand due to fewer families decorating their tables for thanksgiving, and prices plummeted. I had invested early enough that I thought I would still be fine, but then on the morning of December 2nd, a new email in my inbox caused my stomach to turn into a pretzel. The massive gourd shipment from Argentina, scheduled for early March, had arrived. I was planning on selling off my futures right before this, in February, but this ruined everything. To top it off, the gourds in this shipment were absolutely gargantuan, some topping 4 pounds each, causing the price-per-pound to drop like an anchor into the range of 6 cents per pound. I am ruined.”</p>
        <p>Now, at first glance this might seem like a fake post meant to get a laugh from the sub. But after some digging through his post history, Redditors dredged up a post in the r/investing sub, a month prior, where u/TheEmperorOfJenks tried to convince others to join him in his ornamental gourds venture. Another post in the r/tulsa sub was more telling. Here he asked if anyone knew where he could buy ornamental gourds in bulk. Was there a local farm nearby? He needed about 1,500 or so gourds. When someone asked why in God’s name would he want so many gourds, u/TheEmperorOfJenks gave this answer:</p>
        <p>“Due to local fluctuations in the tropopause, the jet stream has been shifting rapidly in a counterclockwise vector, causing a rapid disincorporation of the Hadley vortex cells in the lower ionosphere. Because of this, the geostrophic solar wind balance has deteriorated rapidly in the northern hemisphere. In essence, autumnal weather patterns in the western United States will lead to the biggest ornamental gourd yield in recorded history. Investing in gourd agricultural futures could likely produce up to $1600 per day in passive income. However, investing at the apex of the curve would be the most conducive to profit as the arbitrage (particularly 12b-1 fees) will develop at a market share higher than the back-end load. Basically, no one will be able to buy the stock at a higher price than you, and all value invested will be retained. A preliminary market penetration investment of $50,000 would be most efficient in generating this revenue.”</p>
        <p>In short, the man bought gourds—actual gourds it appears, and not futures—when supply had never been higher and when demand was scrapping rock-bottom. Commenters in the thread visualized u/TheEmperorOfJenks panicking as he watched his Argentinian shipment pulling into port, gargantuan gourds spilling off the sides.</p>
        <p>Was all of this story true? Definitely not. Gourds futures are not a thing. It seemed to be an elaborate troll, but it fit right in with the sub.</p>
        <p>*Vincent Kosuga and Sam Siegel were two futures traders in 1955 who cornered the onions market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Their gamble and the subsequent crash in the onions market resulted in the ban of futures trading in onions.</p>
        <p class="blog-section">***</p>
        <p>“I may have lost 4M,” a mystery bear posted to the sub one day in late April of 2020, “but the Fed has cost this nation everything. Congrats to the bulls and the longs. Enjoy it while it lasts.” This poor bear, u/If_I_Was_Hayek, had turned an original $150,000 investment into $4 million, and then ultimately $21,000, because he had made a critical mistake. Well, two if you consider that he didn’t take any profits off the table.</p>
        <p>But his main mistake was one that many made after the March Crash of 2020: They didn’t pause to think that Federal Reserve Chairman, Jerome Powell, First of His Name, had perhaps the most powerful printer in financial history. When asked by the House Financial Services Committee in June about what to expect going forward with a new economy molded by COVID-19, Powell said, “We are not thinking about putting down our tools for a long time.” National debt had increased in February of 2020 from $23.4 trillion to $27.9 trillion just a year later, almost a 20% increase. It was estimated that 22% of all US dollars had been printed in 2020. But a lot of the dollars weren’t physically printed; they were digital dollars created to buy up government bonds and other securities. This policy, known as quantitative easing (QE), simply pumps the markets with cash to keep borrowing cheap and increase lending to consumers and businesses. Which makes sense considering the fiscal blow the coronavirus dealt to the economy.</p>
        <p>Of course, there’s a debate on whether this is wise long-term for the markets—some worry that the Federal Reserve gobbling up assets could lead to a Lost Decade much like Japan experienced after their own central bank, the Bank of Japan (BOJ), started purchasing private assets in the late 1980s to prop up prices. This policy of easy money led to images of illusory growth while the underlying fundamentals stagnated. Soon, the more Japan tried to stimulate the economy, the less it responded. Sort of like a drug tolerance.</p>
        <p>For a time, asset prices climbed in Japan, which usually occurs whenever interest rates are artificially lowered for long stretches. When the BOJ increased interest rates from 2.5 to 6% between 1988 and 1990, the bubble burst and economic growth took on the urgency of molasses. So the BOJ backtracked. They turned to Keynesian fixes such as printing money, lowering interest rates, and increasing the government deficit between 1991 and 1995. Japan attempted nine stimulus packages during this time, totaling $1.3 trillion. But the economy didn’t budge.</p>
        <p>From 1995 to 1998, Japanese banks wrote off over 50 trillion in yen in bad loans. The BOJ helped the banks by purchasing trillions of yen in commercial paper. Growth didn’t really budge, so the BOJ asked American economist Paul Krugman what they should do. He advised them to pump 35.5 trillion yen into the banks.</p>
        <p>The BOJ tried different tactics of QE over the years and in 2016 announced negative interest rates. Some European countries have followed suit since. When asked about negative interest rates and their possible impact on financial markets, Warren Buffett said, “I would say that’s the most important question in the world. And I don’t know the answer.”</p>
        <p>Right now, the Federal Reserve has interest rates between 0% and 0.25% and negative rates in the U.S. seem possible in the future. While the U.S. GDP has plummeted from the effects of COVID-19, the stock market has risen to dizzying heights in the year since the March Crash of 2020.</p>
        <p>Jerome Powell said in March of 2021 that the Fed was “still a long way from our goals.” So dovish policies will continue for the time being.</p>
        <p>Sad bear noises.</p>
