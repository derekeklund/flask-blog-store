            <p>The #1 finance site in the world, and possibly the universe, <a href="meet_the_team" class="styled-hyperlinks">FinnRizz.com</a>, would like to thank you for stopping by.</p>
            <p>We’re just a couple of guys who used to buy SPY weeklies back in the old WallStreetBets days. You know… “traders”. Some of us still set aside some play money for the occasional out of the money prayer call for old time’s sake. Some of us have graduated to Theta Gang. Some of us are still retarded. All of us love the market. Specifically, options and Jim Cramer's shiny head.</p>
            <p>Nothing is sacred here. The Fed is gay. I’m banned from the NYSE trading floor for bullshit reasons that we don’t have to get into.</p>
            <p class="centered-text">Cheers from the <a href="meet_the_team" class="styled-hyperlinks">FinRizz Team</a>.</p>
